* Open the settings screen (the gear icon at the bottom right), go to the "third party packages" tab, and install Pygame. Don't dismiss the window until the word "FINISHED" appears.

### VS Code + Python

* Download and install the latest version of Python (currently 3.8.5) [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - make sure you turn on the tick box to install Python into the path.
* Download and install VS code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* Start VS code. Go to file / preferences / extensions. Search for and install the Python extension. Detailed instructions [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) if needed.
* Press Windows and X keys together, and select to open Windows Powershell (Admin). Type the command pip install pygame to install the Pygame library onto your system.
* [Video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj_mHL3EA_Y) of installing Python, VS Code and how to install packages (though it is targeted to a different course so demonstrates installing packages different to Pygame)
